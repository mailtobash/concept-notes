ACID is a concept (and an acronym) that refers to the four properties of a transaction in a database system, which are: 

Transaction:
A transaction is a sequence of operations that are executed as a single unit of work

Atomicity - All or Nothing - all data is modified or nothing is modified.  
Consistency - Transaction maintains data integrity constraints, leaving the data consistent. 
Isolation - Isolation of each transaction, ensuring that the transaction will not be changed by any other concurrent transaction. 
Durability - Once a transaction is completed and committed, its changes are persisted permanently in the database.
